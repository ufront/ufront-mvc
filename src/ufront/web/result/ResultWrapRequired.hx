/**
A collection of flags describing operations that are required to wrap any controller return type into a `FutureActionOutcome`.

In our `Controller.execute()` methods, we return a consistent `Future<Outcome<ActionResult,tink.core.Error>>` type, despite the return type of the method/action executed.

This is used by the `Controller` build macro, and the `Controller.execute()` method in conjunction with `haxe.EnumFlags` to know which wrapping operations are required on a given result.
